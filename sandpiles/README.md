## Requirement
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Programs and function will be compiles with `gcc` 4.8.4` usign the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`
- All files should end with a new line
- No global variable allowed
- No more than 5 function per file
- Standard library allowed
- The prototypes of all functions should be included in your header file called sandpiles.h

Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles

- Prototype: `void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);`
- You can assume that both `grid1` and `grid2` are individually stable
- A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
- When your function is done, `grid1` must be stable
- `grid1` must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable (See example)
- Youâ€™re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically
