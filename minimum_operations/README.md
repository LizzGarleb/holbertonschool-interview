## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`

In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

- Prototype: `def minOperations(n)`
- Returns an integer
- If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`
